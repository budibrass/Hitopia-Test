SOAL  1
POIN: 2
Given a binary array, find the maximum number of consecutive 1s in this array.
Example_____________________________ 

Input: [1,1,0,1,1,1]
Output: 3
Explanation: The first two digits or the last three digits are consecutive 1s. The maximum number of consecutive 1s is 3.


Input: [1,0,0,1,0,1,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: The first two digits or the last three digits are consecutive 1s. The maximum number of consecutive 1s is 2.


Note_________________________________ 


The input array will only contain 0 and 1
The length of input array is a positive integer and will not exceed 10.000


SOAL  2
POIN: 3
Write a function that reverses a string using a recursive function. Input of function using char[] or array of character
Example_____________________________ 

Input: ["h","e","l","l","o"]
Output: ["o","l","l","e","h"]


Note_________________________________
You can’t using default function reserve
You can’t using looping for reserve function
only can use recursive for solved
SOAL  3
POIN: 5
Write function to find Balanced Brackets. Bracket is considered to be any one of the following characters: ( , ) , { , } , [ , or ]. Check brackets matched pairs between opening bracket and close bracket with return string YES or NO. 
Example_____________________________ 

Input: { [ ( ) ] }
Output: YES


Explanation: every bracket it’s balance, between opening bracket and close bracket:
opening : { it’s balance with }
opening : [ it’s balance with ]
opening : ( it’s balance with }


Input: { [ ( ] ) }
Output: NO


Explanation: The string { [ ( ] ) } is not balanced because the brackets enclosed by the matched pair { and } are not balanced: [ ( ] ).


Input: { ( ( [ ] ) [ ] ) [ ] }
Output: YES


Explanation: every bracket it’s balance, between opening bracket and close bracket, although the structure of bracket irregular
